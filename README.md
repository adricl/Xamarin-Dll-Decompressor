# Xamarin Dll Decompressor

Decompresses Xamerin files that are packaged inside APK files. 

These files are compressed in a special method discovered by https://www.x41-dsec.de/security/news/working/research/2020/09/22/xamarin-dll-decompression/
I have converted the python script to C# for easy of use by C# devs.

All credit goes to Christian Reitter good work.
